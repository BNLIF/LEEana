Detailed steps for analysis:

###### preparation ###### 

1. ./convert_bdt.pl
   Calculate the new BDT scores
   Remove events used in the training ...
   output is stored in ./checkout_rootfiles_correct_bdt


##### CV files ##### 

For data, need to run the pot tool to get POTs
./bin/pot_counting #bnb_file                   --> get the POT for BNB ...
./bin/pot_counting #bnb_file  #extbnb_file -m2 --> get the POT for EXTBNB ...
change ext_POT in ./configuration/cv_input.txt

2. ./convert_cv.pl
   For CV rootfiles, elimate duplicated events
   Also remove failed run/subrun, if the failed percentage is larger than 20% (default)
   output is stored  ./processed_checkout_rootfiles

3 ./convert_histo.pl
  For CV rootfiles, store the histograms in ./hist_rootfiles ...

4. ./bin/merge_hist -r1  (form CV comparison with standard error propogation)
   cv file is stored in merge.root ....

5. ./run_mc_stat.pl (for MC statistics)
    output are stored inside mc_stat/

###### detector systematic uncertainties ######

6. ./merge_det.pl
    Merge the detector files into one ...
    output are stored inside ./hist_rootfiles/DetVar/

7. ./run_det_sys.pl
    Running the detector systematics with bootstrapping
    output are stored inside ./hist_rootfiles/DetVar/

##### Xs and Flux uncertainties ######
